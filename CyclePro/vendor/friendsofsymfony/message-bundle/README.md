Legacy (Symfony 2, or <=3.3)
------

Due to difficulties in CI testing, deprecation of the `Controller` class and the [deprecation coming November of this year (2019)][] support for anything older than Symfony3.4 (LTS) has been dropped in this bundle.

For more info, see the pull request that ultimately made the decision for us - https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSMessageBundle/pull/340

If using versions older than Symfony3.4 (LTS), make sure to use version 1.3 of this bundle.
